Parish-Register
===============

Parish Register is a Java GUI app for digitizing old parish registers.
It was build for securing data of former students of Gimnazija "Fran
GaloviÄ‡" Koprivnica. 

The main purpose is to have a permanent database 
of every student so everyone could raise verification of school attendance.

It creates a database that recognises students, and can be searched through
from few perspectives.

Build with NetBeans.
